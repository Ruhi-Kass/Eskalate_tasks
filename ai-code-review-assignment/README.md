This public GitHub repository contains my complete submission for the **Eskalate AI Code Review Assignment** (submitted January 2026).

## Assignment Overview

The purpose of this assignment was to demonstrate the ability to:

- Carefully review AI-generated Python code and technical explanations
- Identify correctness issues, bugs, edge cases, and robustness problems
- Propose and implement safe, minimal, and production-ready fixes
- Rewrite misleading or incorrect explanations to accurately reflect the improved behavior
- Make clear engineering judgments (Approve / Request Changes / Reject) with solid reasoning

The assignment consisted of **three independent tasks**:

1. **Task 1** — Average Order Value  
2. **Task 2** — Count Valid Emails  
3. **Task 3** — Aggregate Valid Measurements  

All three original AI-generated implementations contained **serious correctness and robustness issues**.

## Repository Structure

This repository follows the **exact required structure**:
